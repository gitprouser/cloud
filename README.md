Remote Execution Support
===========================
This script framework would allow for jobs to be executed from Service Manager to client. A piece of code in Ruby, Python, Java and Shell should be executed from the remote client on the VM. The remote execution script would be executed at boot time and would exist over the duration of the VM. There are two pieces to the this job. The server side and the client side.
